## Knowledge Validation

### **Core Competency Assessment**

#### **Question 1: Incident Handling Capability Components**
A successful incident handling capability should include:
- ✅ **Skills** - Technical competencies for threat analysis
- ✅ **Roles** - Clear responsibilities and authority
- ✅ **Procedures** - Standardized response processes
- ❌ Practices (too vague)
- ❌ Reviews (part of process, not core component)

#### **Question 2: Incident Response Plan Goals**
The goal of an incident response plan is to detect, respond, and **identify** compromises, incidents, and risks.

#### **Question 3: Backup Storage Strategy**
Organizations should store backups **offsite, segmented from primary operations** to ensure availability during disasters affecting primary facilities.

#### **Question 4: Site Book Information Exclusions**
Site books should NOT include **Employee PII** as this creates unnecessary privacy risks and is not required for system reconstruction.

#### **Question 5: SOC Definition**
SOC stands for **Security Operations Center** - the centralized facility for monitoring and protecting organizational assets.

#### **Question 6: CSIRT Team Models**
A **Coordinating team** model provides overarching central guidance and coordination among distributed teams.

#### **Question 7: Crisis Communication Role**
The **Crisis communicator** effectively communicates incident details to stakeholders.

#### **Question 8: Tool Development Role**
The **Software developer** builds and maintains tools used by the CSIRT.
